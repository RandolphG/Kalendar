# Kalendar

> Develop only the frontend part of the solution, but you are free to use any frontend
framework (SSR is okay as well)

> There should be a month calendar that shows the launch events

> Please do not use existing calendar components but develop your own

> The point above does not apply to other components


> There should be a selector of Agencies (if you have enough time add support for viewing
multiple agencies)


> When the user clicks on a launch event, a countdown (T-time before the launch or T+time
after the launch) should be displayed somewhere on the page
